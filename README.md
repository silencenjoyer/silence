# üçÉ Silence Framework Monorepo

This is the monorepository for the Silence Framework - a set of modular PHP packages designed for building lightweight, flexible applications with minimal dependencies and maximum extensibility.  

Silence is based on the [Symfony DependencyInjection](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html) container and aims to provide clean abstractions for request handling, event dispatching, and application flow.

## üéØ Goals:
- Full modularity: use only what you need.
- Minimal boilerplate: strong defaults and clean architecture üêù
- Separated components: follow PSR standards wherever possible.
- Good DX: built-in testing, type safety, and modern PHP.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Code Quality:
- Tests: ``composer test`` 
- Static analysis: ``php vendor/bin/phpstan``
- Composer dependency analyze: ``php vendor/bin/composer-dependency-analyser``
- PSR-12 formatting

## üîÄ Package Splitting:
